# Program to find vendor, it run in Python3

This is a small program to find the vendor from a list of MAC addresses. This is useful if you have a large list and want to know who the vendor of those devices is.

âš  Consider creating a file named "macaddress.txt" and change this line to the directory where your list will be.

### file = open('/mnt/c/Temp/macaddress.txt','r').read().splitlines()
